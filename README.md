## 🔭 Overview
This project serves as a digital storefront for a fictional coffee brand. It includes a fully navigational interface allowing users to explore coffee blends, view bakery items, locate outlets, and access a member login area. 

The primary goal of this project was to master **CSS Flexbox** for layout management and media queries for mobile responsiveness, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Responsive Navigation Bar:** * Features a flexible layout that adapts from a horizontal menu on desktop to a stacked, touch-friendly layout on mobile.
* **CSS Grid & Flexbox Layouts:** * utilized for the product cards (Hot/Cold coffee sections) and the footer to ensure alignment and spacing consistency.
* **Multi-Page Architecture:** * Includes distinct pages for Home (`index.html`), Bakery (`bakery.html`), About Us (`about.html`), Outlets (`outlets.html`), and Login (`login.html`).
* **Interactive Elements:** * Hover effects on buttons, navigation links, and product cards to enhance user engagement.
* **Semantic HTML5:** * Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>` tags for better accessibility and SEO structure.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure and semantic markup.
* **CSS3:** Styling, variables, and media queries.
* **Font Awesome:** Scalable vector icons for UI elements.
* **Google Fonts:** Typography (Segoe UI).
